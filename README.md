# fosh

This project simulates a virtual fish tank where fosh swim around and interact with one another, as well as food, based on principles inspired by *Boid* behavior. The simulation includes various mechanics like food attraction, flocking behaviors (cohesion, separation, and alignment), and crowding avoidance. The fish also interact with walls and avoid the edges of the tank.
